## Abstract
Following step-by-step procedures is an essential component of various activities carried out by individuals in their everyday lives.
These procedures serve as a guiding framework that helps achieve goals efficiently, whether assembling furniture or preparing a recipe.
However, the complexity and duration of procedural activities inherently increase the likelihood of making errors.
Understanding such procedural activities from a sequence of frames is a challenging task that demands an accurate
interpretation of visual information and an ability to reason about the structure of the activity.
To this end, we collected a new egocentric 4D dataset Captain Cook comprising 384 recordings (94.5 hrs) of people performing recipes in real kitchen environments.
This dataset consists of two distinct activity types: one in which participants adhere to the provided recipe instructions and another where they deviate and induce errors.
We provide 5.3K step annotations and 10K fine-grained action annotations and benchmark it on the following tasks: supervised error recognition, multi-step localization and procedure learning.

## Error Synopsis

A structured synopsis of different types of errors and their short descriptions compiled from the annotations.
We classified common errors performed during a cooking activity into the following categories 
(1) Preparation Error, (2) Measurement Error, (3)  Technique Error, (4) Timing Error, (5) Temperature Error, (6) Missing Steps, and (7) Ordering Error.
